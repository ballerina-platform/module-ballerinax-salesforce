    # Read-only field that indicates whether the opportunity has associated line items. A value of true means that Opportunity line items have been created for the opportunity. An opportunity can have opportunity line items only if the opportunity has a price book. The opportunity line items must correspond to PricebookEntry objects that are listed in the opportunity Pricebook2. However, you can insert opportunity line items on an opportunity that does not have an associated Pricebook2. For the first opportunity line item that you insert on an opportunity without a Pricebook2, the API automatically sets the Pricebook2Id field, if the opportunity line item corresponds to a PricebookEntry in an active Pricebook2 that has a CurrencyIsoCode field that matches the CurrencyIsoCode field of the opportunity. If the Pricebook2 is not active or the CurrencyIsoCode fields do not match, then the API returns an error. You can’t update the Pricebook2Id or PricebookId fields if opportunity line items exist on the Opportunity. You must delete the line items before attempting to update the PricebookId field.

Supplying values in both fields is allowed if the values add up to the same amount of time. If both fields are null, the duration defaults to one day. If IsAllDayEvent is false, a value must be supplied for either DurationInMinutes or EndDateTime. Supplying values in both fields is allowed if the values add up to the same amount of time.

API versions 12.0 and earlier can’t access event objects whose DurationInMinutes is greater than 1440. For more information, see Multiday Events.

This value is available in API 49.0 and later. ReportEvent—Tracks when reports are run in your org. SessionHijackingEventStore—Tracks when unauthorized users gain ownership of a Salesforce user’s session with a stolen session identifier. To detect such an event, Salesforce evaluates how significantly a user’s current browser fingerprint diverges from the previously known fingerprint using a probabilistically inferred significance of change. This value is available in API 49.0 and later.

After due date: The next repeating task will be due the specified number of days after the current task’s due date. After the task is closed: The next repeating task will be due the specified number of days after the current task is closed. (Task closed): This task, now closed, was opened as part of a repeating series. When tasks in a series are set to repeat after their due date, Salesforce doesn’t create recurrences that would have been due in the past. Instead, Salesforce keeps adding the interval until a repeated task has a due date in the future. For example, suppose that someone sets a task to repeat three days after it’s due. But, that person doesn’t complete the task (mark it Closed) until five days after it’s due. Instead of creating a task that’s already overdue, Salesforce gives the new task a due date of tomorrow. This due date is equivalent to 6 days after the due date; two intervals of three days each. If that person completes the repeating task (marks it Closed) before the due date, the next task is still due three days after the due date.

After users enable location services in Salesforce Authenticator, they can designate trusted locations. When a user trusts a location for a particular activity, such as logging in from a recognized device, that activity is approved from the trusted location for as long as the location is trusted. Denied—The user denied the approval request in the authenticator app, such as Salesforce Authenticator. FailedGeneralError—An error caused by something other than an invalid verification code, too many verification attempts, or authenticator app connectivity. FailedInvalidCode—The user entered an invalid verification code. FailedInvalidPassword—The user entered an invalid password. FailedPasswordLockout—The user attempted to enter a password too many times. FailedTooManyAttempts—The user attempted to verify identity too many times. For example, the user entered an invalid verification code repeatedly. Initiated—Salesforce initiated identity verification but hasn’t yet challenged the user. InProgress—Salesforce challenged the user to verify identity and is waiting for the user to respond or for Salesforce Authenticator to send an automated response. RecoverableError—Salesforce can’t reach the authenticator app to verify identity, but it continues to retry.

    string SourceIp?;
    # The 18-character ID for the record of the geographic location of the user for a successful or unsuccessful identity verification attempt. Due to the nature of geolocation technology, the accuracy of geolocation fields (for example, country, city, postal code) can vary.
    string LoginGeoId?;
    # The text the user sees on the page or in Salesforce Authenticator when prompted to verify identity. For example, if identity verification is required for a user’s login, the user sees “You’re trying to Log In to Salesforce.” In this case, the Remarks value is “Log In to Salesforce.” But if the Activity value is Apex, the Remarks value is a custom description passed by an Apex method. If the user is verifying identity using Salesforce Authenticator, the custom description also appears in the app. If the custom description isn’t specified, the value is the name of the Apex method. The label is Activity Message.

This verification is triggered when the user tries to access a resource, such as a connected app, report, or dashboard, that requires a high-assurance session level. LightningLogin—Identity verification required for internal users logging in via Lightning Login. This verification is triggered when the enrolled user attempts to log in. Users are eligible to log in if they have the Lightning Login User user permission and have successfully enrolled in Lightning Login. Also, from Session Settings in Setup, Allow Lightning Login must be enabled. PageAccess—Identity verification required for users attempting to perform an action, such as changing an email address or adding a verification method for multi-factor authentication (MFA). PasswordlessLogin—Identity verification required for customers attempting to log in to an Experience Cloud site that is set up for passwordless login. The admin controls which registered verification methods can be used, for example, email, SMS, Salesforce Authenticator, or TOTP. ProfilePolicy—Session security level required at login. This verification is triggered by the Session security level required at login setting on the user’s profile. TwoFactorAuthentication—Multi-factor authentication (formerly called two-factor authentication) required at login.

However, if Salesforce encounters a UserProvAccountStaging object with a matching ExternalUserId but different LinkState and SalesforceUserId values during this process, Salesforce checks the UserProvAccount IsKnownLink value. If the IsKnownLinkvalue is true, Salesforce doesn’t copy the LinkState and SalesforceUserId values from the UserProvAccountStaging object to the UserProvAccount object (all other values are copied). The default is false, meaning Salesforce manages the account relationship.
